## Vision

The Skill-Based Credentialing System is a decentralized platform designed to issue and verify digital certificates for courses completed by students. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to provide a secure, transparent, and immutable record of achievements, enabling students and professionals to showcase their skills and knowledge with confidence.

## Flowchart

1. **Create Course**: 
   - Instructors create a new course.
   - A unique course ID is generated and stored on the blockchain.

2. **Issue Certificate**:
   - Authorized instructors issue certificates to students who have completed the course.
   - Certificates are linked to both the student's address and the course ID.

3. **Verify Certificate**:
   - Anyone can verify the authenticity of a certificate by querying the blockchain.
   - The certificate's details, including the studentâ€™s address, course name, instructor, and issue date, are returned.


## Contract Address

- **Network**: educhain
- **Contract Address**: 0x789641143238d25f8977d1EE76AC10Bd01EAf2Aa
- **Deployed By**: sanatan prasad sah

## Future Scope

- **Multi-Instructor Support**: Allow multiple instructors to issue certificates for the same course.
- **Course Completion Validation**: Integrate with learning management systems (LMS) to automatically issue certificates upon course completion.
- **Decentralized Verification**: Expand verification mechanisms to include decentralized identity solutions.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Enable certificates to be shared across professional networks and social media platforms.

## Getting Started
